## Story

In 2022, Lucas was three years old and painted
his first doodles: two stick figures
representing him and his brother. Inspired by
this, I decided to create a video game where
Lucas and his little brother Felix could control
these characters with their bodies.

Lucas created all the sounds and art for the
game, with some help from me and Felix.
